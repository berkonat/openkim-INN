# openkim-INN
OpenKIM integration for Implanted Neural Network Potentials.

## OpenKIM Binding
INN potentials are implemented using KIM API. The main code of the potential is the model driver and its routines in KIM API architecture. 
The model driver base to compile and integrate the routines in KIM API lives at OpenKIM repository. As of now, INN model driver can be access with the following KIM ID and link:

INN_MD_XXXXXXXXXXXX_000
Link: http://www.openkim.org/

INN is developed using Torch7 which is a scientific computing framework for machine learning and is based on C, Lua/LuaJIT.

The parameters of INN potentials are KIM models.  

The core code of the INN model can be accessed using
git clone git@github.com/berkonat/openkim-INN

## Model Driver

## Models
The models are listed as follows:

Li-Si
KIM ID : LiSi_INN_MO_XXXXXXXXXXXX_000
Info: Developed for crystal phases of Li and Si, amorphous Si and amorphous Li-Si alloys.
